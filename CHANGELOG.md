> {warning} This update changes how SEO meta is stored. We **STRONGLY** 
recommend backing up your site before installing this update.

> {warning} This update contains some potentially breaking changes. If you use a 
custom `meta.twig` template you should review the

### Added
- Advanced option for overriding the canonical URL.

### Changed
- Craft 3.1.0 is now required.

certain parts of the title to be editable and adding twig support for pre-filling 
from fields! (Existing meta will be automatically upgraded)

- Robots meta tags are now rendered in the SEO meta. Useful for statically 
cached sites!

### Fixed

## 3.4.0 - 2018-09-06

> {warning} This update contains some potentially breaking changes. If you use a custom `meta.twig` template you should review the changes [here](https://github.com/ethercreative/seo/commits/v3/src/templates/_seo/meta.twig).

### Added
- Added `getSeoField($handle = 'seo')` Twig function for Site templates.

- The default `robots.txt` now disallows all when the environment is NOT set to `'production'`. 
This will not have an effect for existing installs (where the SEO settings have been saved).
To manually update your `robots.txt`, replace the line `{% if craft.app.config.general.devMode %}` with `{% if craft.app.config.env != 'production' %}`. [#122]
- Redirects are no longer case-sensitive [#116]

### Fixed

- Protocol relative image URLs are now handled correctly. [#125], [#126] (via [@monachilada])

### Improved

- Redirects now support full PCRE syntax. [#119], [#127]
