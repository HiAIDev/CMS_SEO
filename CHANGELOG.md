## 3.2.0 - WIP
### TODO
- [ ] Manage `robots.txt`, with default value (i.e. defining the sitemap url) per site?

### Added
- You can now manage your sites ðŸ¤– on a site-wide or per-field basis
	- The `X-Robots-Tag` header is added if you've set any robots
	- If the current entry has an expiry date, the `unavailable_after` directive will be added automatically
